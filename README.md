# 🏠 House Prices - Regression Modeling

This project is part of my portfolio as I grow in data science and machine learning.  
The goal was to predict house prices using a variety of regression techniques, with a focus on interpretability and performance.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- ✅ Trained a **CatBoost regressor** for structured data
- ✅ Applied **GridSearch with cross-validation** for hyperparameter tuning
- ✅ Evaluated performance using **MAE** and **R²**
- ✅ Plotted and analyzed **residual distributions** to check model fit and variance
- ✅ Focused on a smooth, reproducible workflow with clear metric tracking

## 📊 Final Metrics

| Model     | MAE    | R²    |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| CatBoost  | 0.110  | 0.91  |

## 📉 Key Techniques Used

- Cross-validation with `GridSearchCV`
- CatBoost modeling with automatic handling of categorical features
- Residual plot analysis for visual error diagnosis
- Submission preparation for Kaggle leaderboard evaluation

## 🔜 Next Steps

- Build a **baseline model pipeline** (automated log-transforming, encoding, basic tuning)
- Add SHAP for model explainability and feature impact
- Compare model generalization across multiple CV folds
